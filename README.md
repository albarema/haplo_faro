# haplo_faro

Population structure and local ancestry inference of a certain population (we used it for Faroese's) using a window-based (phased) haplotype clustering approach. The neural network (NN) can be used in whole-genome data.  More details about the NN here: [Haplonet github](https://github.com/Rosemeis/HaploNet)
